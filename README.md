# leaflet-challenge

Challenge to use HTML, JS, d3, Leaflet, and the USGS GeoJSON Feed to create a map plotting earthquakes. The size of the circles reflect the magnitude, larger magnitudes mean larger circles, while the colors reflect the depth of the earthquake, deeper depths mean darker colors.

Link to the USGS GeoJSON API (All Earthquakes in the past day was used in logic.js): https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
